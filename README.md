# Memory Game

## About

The code in the current repository was developed as a part of the "Object-Oriented Programming" undergraduate course that took place during the 3rd semester at the School of Informatics of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. It is an attempt of developing a simple card memorizing game with Java using Swing.

## Branches

Two different branches can be found in this repository.

The master branch contains the terminal user interface version, while the GUI-version branch, as its name suggests, deploys a graphical user interface for the project.
